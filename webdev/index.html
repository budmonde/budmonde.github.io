# What is a web app?

####Website:

- a location in the Internet containing web pages

--

- a more anal definition: a collection of static web pages which is mainly content driven

--

####Web App:

--

- in contrast to a website, dynamic and action driven

- .bold[point is]: it's a more complex system you can't easily create by using a something like a blogging platform

---

## What is a web page


![Webpage demo](webpage.png)

---

# What makes a web page?

--
- HTML
```html
<div class="text-box">
  <p>So text. Much HTML. Wow.</p>
</div> 
```
--
- CSS
```css
.text-box {
  font-family: "Comic Sans";
  color: pink;
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
```
--
- Javascript
```javascript
var doge = "moar text";
console.log(doge);
```
--
- Assets: images, fonts, videos blablablabla

---
## What does your browser do?

--

![Internet Explorer](browser.png)

#### Questions so far?

---

class: center, middle

#### So far: if we have all these files, we can display web pages and have them dynamic with the js code.

---

class: center, middle

#### Problem: we can't store all of Facebook on you local machine...

---

# What delivers a web page?

- Solution: a server machine

--

![Req-res diagram](reqres.png)

---

## A web page request

- Destination + port: https://fb.com:443

- Type: GET

- Other things: cookies, GPS etc. etc. etc.

---

## is responded with the web page

- Origin: https://fb.com:443

- HTML, CSS, JS, Assets

- Other things: target address (just in case) blablabla

---

# What else can a web app do?

- Ask the server to do other things!

  - Upload photos, edit profile etc.

- More formally, the types of requests:

  - GET to request data and POST to send new data/actions

  - .gray[PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH blablabla things we don't need to care about]

---

# What makes a web server?

- A good architecture tailored for the tasks a server does

--

#### A server has:

- Routes

- Views

- Assets / access to a databse

---

## Routes

- facebook.com .red[/ budmonde]
- docs.google.com .red[/ presentation/d/blablabla]
- xkcd.com .red[/ 1077]

etc. etc.

- A sublocation within the server that triggers a specific action on the server

![Example Route](route.png)

---

## Views

are different templates for inputting data and creating a HTML page.

![FB template](template.png)

---

## Assets / access to a database

- The data the web app stores, manipulates etc.

- CSS, JS files (could be regarded as part of views)

- Fonts, images, etc.

---

## So how do these all fit together?

# Workshop: Demo web app using Express.js

---

class: center, middle

#### Node.js installation instructions: 

10 minute break. Please install node.js during this time. We can help out if you have issues.

---

## What is Express.js?

- A framework built on Node.js which is a web server framework built on Javascript

--

- Node.js allows you to set up a web server easily using Javascript

- Express.js adds further "infrastructure" to make it easier to build well organized web apps.

---

Task 0. Clone a bare Express.js application.
```terminal
git clone https://github.com/mit6148/express-workshop.git

cd express-workshop

git checkout tags/v0.0

```

---

## Let's see what's inside

```terminal
bin/  --> config files setting up server stuff and ports

node_modules/ --> node.js packages that make things work

public/   --> public files directly accessible by clients (js, css, fonts etc.)

routes/   --> routes

views/    --> views

app.js    --> the code that instantiates and runs the application
              configures all other parts of application

package.json  --> application meta data; node.js packages the app uses
```

---

class: center, middle
Task 0.1. Let's try running the server locally.
 
```terminal
cd express-workshop

npm install

npm start
``` 

---

You should see something like:

### Express

Welcome to Express

---

## What did we just do?

- Downloaded, installed/updated the packages as specified in `package.json`

--

- Started a local node.js server and opened port `3000` to respond to `HTTP` requests. The terminal is now making your computer run the server.

--

- In our browser, accessed the local server at port `3000` and made a `GET` request to route "`/`"

--

- In fact because connecting to the MIT network gives you a public IP address you can make requests from any other computer on the Internet if you know the IP address of the server (your computer).

Task 0.1 Download template HTML.

```terminal

git checkout tags/v0.1

```

![Ugly HTML Form](v0.1.png)

Task 0.2 Basic styling.

```terminal

git checkout tags/v0.2

```

Task 0.3 Import janky database


```terminal

git checkout tags/v0.3

```

---

class: center, middle

Question. Look at `public/db.json` and `routes/index.js`. What do you think the following code does?

```javascript

var db = require('../public/db.json');

```

---

class: center, middle

Harder question. Where would the `db` be printed if we added the following line?

```javascript

var db = require('../public/db.json');

console.log(db);

```

Task 1.0. The real deal. What do we do to add a user?

---

class: center, middle

Task 2.0. What do we do to delete a user?
