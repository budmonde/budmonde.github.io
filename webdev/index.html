# What is a web app?

####Website:

- a location in the Internet containing web pages

--

- a more anal definition: a collection of static web pages which is mainly content driven

--

####Web App:

--

- in contrast to a website, dynamic and action driven

- .bold[point is]: it's a more complex system you can't easily create by using a something like a blogging platform

---

## What is a web page


![Webpage demo](webpage.png)

---

# What makes a web page?

--
- HTML
```html
<div class="text-box">
  <p>So text. Much HTML. Wow.</p>
</div> 
```
--
- CSS
```css
.text-box {
  font-family: "Comic Sans";
  color: pink;
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
```
--
- Javascript
```javascript
var doge = "moar text";
console.log(doge);
```
--
- Assets: images, fonts, videos blablablabla

---

#### Questions so far?

---

class: center, middle

#### So far: if we have all these files, we can display web pages and have them dynamic with the js code.

#### Problem: we can't store all of Facebook on you local machine...

---

# What delivers a web page?

- Solution: a server machine

--

![Req-res diagram](reqres.png)

---

## A web page request

- Destination + port: https://fb.com:443

- Type: GET

- Other things: cookies, GPS etc. etc. etc.

---

## is responded with the web page

- Origin: https://fb.com:443

- HTML, CSS, JS, Assets

- Other things: target address (just in case) blablabla

---

# What else can a web app do?

- Ask the server to do other things!

  - Upload photos, edit profile etc.

- More formally, the types of requests:

  - GET to request data and POST to send new data/actions

  - .gray[PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH blablabla things we don't need to care about]

---

# What makes a web server?

- A good architecture tailored for the tasks a server does

--

#### A server has:

- Routes

- Views

- Assets / access to a databse

---

## Routes

- facebook.com .red[/ budmonde]
- docs.google.com .red[/ presentation/d/blablabla]
- xkcd.com .red[/ 1077]

etc. etc.

- A sublocation within the server that triggers a specific action on the server

![Example Route](route.png)

---

## Views

are different templates for inputting data and creating a HTML page.

![FB template](template.png)

---

## Assets / access to a database

- The data the web app stores, manipulates etc.

- CSS, JS files (could be regarded as part of views)

- Fonts, images, etc.

---

## So how do these all fit together?
