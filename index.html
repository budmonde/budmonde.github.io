            <p class="project-details">Next Act is a theatre student group at MIT. As for any non-tech cultured club, the focus on the homepage or reservations website is to make it easy for non-CS majors to pick up the development and carry out the "Webmaster" role easily. But I decided to go ham and ended up making two Meteor applications for signing up for auditions as well as booking tickets. With the amount of WebDev nerds in the student group nowadays, I'm sure they can find someone who fend for the apps. Apps are currently disabled so no link :P</p>

            <p class="project-details">Impression is a (broken) application that was submitted for hackMIT 2015. The interprets an input image and proposes a short Youtube playlist of music that would go along with the theme of the image. The application features several cross-platform APIs in image recognition and NLP to come up with its result. The application was developed along with teammates @zhoul, @ckguo and @ajays235. Link to (broken) site is <a target="_blank" href="http://much-impression.herokuapp.com">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="project-details">As part of an undergraduate research experience, I worked for the Global Studies and Languages Department to produce parts of the project known as AI Teacher. This web application functions to allow foreign learners of the Japanese language a set of tools which would make the learning experience easier. The specific part I worked on featured a sentence parser with predictions on what kind of words come up most often in literature as well as provide lots of details on the syntaxical features the input sentence presented. The application can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://jp-urop-nodeapp.herokuapp.com/aozorabunko">here</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="project-title"><a target="_blank" href="http://icanphysics.herokuapp.com">Harmony</a></h3><h5 class="project-date">Jan 2015</h5>
            <p class="project-details">This application was a collaborative sheet music editor with real time database syncronization which allowed users to concurrently edit the same document. Think Google Docs for music sheets... with clunky UI and cryptic syntax for parsing the music sheets. This Ruby on Rails App was my first Web Development project. Working with @zhoul and @jtxiao was a great experience in understanding the Web framework and putting a presedence on more projects to come.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Monde, you pronounce it like Monday. This has become a common greeting as I stopped finding this line neither funny nor frustrating. Embraced the fact so to speak. Odd names aside, I'm currently a junior at MIT studying Computer Science. I also have some interest in physics having come from a physics background -- participating in fancy International Olympiads during high-school. Please note that as I'm from Mongolia, attending these olympiads is much easier compared to the US so I wasn't actually that legit. With this wide range of academic backgrounds and current studies however, I believe that most of my everyday life and personality is better reflected through my hobbies.</p>
            <p>The hobbies include photography, pool billiards, dancing (hip-hop and breakdancing), a little bit of anime, video games (most notably Dota 2 and CS:GO) and following e-sports. I'd say the most self-distructive one is the latter due to the many hundreds of hours I burn myself out on Twitch. People'd usually expect me to have be very knowledgeable of the notorious Twitch chat community but I know nothing more than Kappa. Kappa. Apart from this, my other hobbies have, do and will probably shape my personality as time goes. My high-school obsession over anime and Japanese culture has died down by now and has since evolved into an interest in animation and the art behind it. Perhaps my amateur photography also takes root from a similar feeling.</p>
            <p>Going forward, I've started to grow some interest in Game Design -- most likely a biproduct of the combination of Computer Science + Animation + e-sports. Often however, I think that following these newly developed interests is too late for me until I realize I'm but only 20. Probably every successful figure in the industry would prove these thoughts wrong. With such thoughts in mind, it's hard to tell whether I currently aspire for anything really. So I guess time will tell. Hell I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up becoming a Youtuber 10 years down the line.</p>
