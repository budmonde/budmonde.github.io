            <p class="project-details">
              Next Act is a theatre student group at MIT. As for any non-tech cultured club, the focus on the homepage or reservations website is to make it easy for non-CS majors to pick up the development and carry out the "Webmaster" role easily. But I decided to go ham and ended up making two Meteor applications for signing up for auditions as well as booking tickets. With the amount of WebDev nerds in the student group nowadays, I'm sure they can find someone who fend for the apps. Apps are currently disabled so no link :P

              Impression is a (broken) application that was submitted for hackMIT 2015. The interprets an input image and proposes a short Youtube playlist of music that would go along with the theme of the image. The application features several cross-platform APIs in image recognition and NLP to come up with its result. The application was developed along with teammates @zhoul, @ckguo and @ajays235.

              As part of an undergraduate research experience, I worked for the Global Studies and Languages Department to produce parts of the project known as AI Teacher. This web application functions to allow foreign learners of the Japanese language a set of tools which would make the learning experience easier. The specific part I worked on featured a sentence parser with predictions on what kind of words come up most often in literature as well as provide lots of details on the syntaxical features the input sentence presented.

              This application was a collaborative sheet music editor with real time database syncronization which allowed users to concurrently edit the same document. Think Google Docs for music sheets... with clunky UI and cryptic syntax for parsing the music sheets. This Ruby on Rails App was my first Web Development project. Working with @zhoul and @jtxiao was a great experience in understanding the Web framework and putting a presedence on more projects to come.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              Greetings! I'm Monde, a third year Computer Science major at MIT. In this future career of nerdy jokes and bad commit messages I hope to find something that I truly enjoy doing. Currently I'm looking at Game Design but I suspect it's just a biproduct of my interest in Computer Science, video games and e-sports, but we'll see how it goes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from video games, I have a couple of more recreational hobbies like photography and dancing.
